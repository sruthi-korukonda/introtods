# Intro to Data Science

Problem Statement:
The film industry is one of the largest revenue generator for the economy. It pays around $49 billion to local businesses and supports 2.1 million jobs and 400,000 local businesses across the country. This industry is the key driver of the U.S. economy. In this project, we try to predict the total box office revenue for a movie picked from the TMDB dataset.

Dataset:

In this project we will be using ‘The Movie Database(TMDb)’. Webpage for the dataset can be found here. This dataset has information on nearly 7398 movies along with metadata..Attributes for each data item include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. Each movie is identified by a unique ID (remakes of a movie is treated as different movie).

Volume : Flat files , nearly 65 MB.
Veracity :  This is a publicly available, verifiable dataset.
Variety :  The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical data in a structured format.
Velocity : With an average of around 2000 movies being made per year, new data is generated at high speed.
Value : Being one of the largest revenue generators for the economy and the rate at which movies are being produced, it is highly beneficial to predict the revenue that a certain movie will make at the box office. Using this prediction algorithm, we can determine the factors that will determine the success of a movie at the box office.
